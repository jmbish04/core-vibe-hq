Storyboard Title:
“From Prompt to Production — The VibeHQ Orchestrated Workflow”

Goal:
Create a cinematic, multi-screen storyboard showing the full lifecycle of an AI-assisted software build in VibeHQ Mission Control — a HeroUI React environment for orchestrating autonomous developer agents, factories, and Cloudflare Workers.
The storyboard should progress smoothly across 6 major screens, showing continuity in theme, color, and data flow.

⸻

🧭 Scene 1 — Project Dashboard (Mission Control Overview)
	•	Dark HeroUI React dashboard with a left sidebar and glowing blue accent.
	•	Show top nav: breadcrumbs (Projects / Helios / Dashboard), user avatar, WebSocket status indicator (green = connected).
	•	Central cards display:
	•	“Recent PRs” table (rows with progress indicators),
	•	“Open Issues” table (severity badges),
	•	“System Health” line chart (errors vs uptime),
	•	“Activity Feed” showing recent logs streaming live.
	•	Bottom-right: an Agent Chat Popup idle with placeholder text “Ask VibeHQ to improve your project…”.

→ Transition: user clicks into chat; screen zooms into the chat popup.

⸻

💬 Scene 2 — Conversational Command
	•	Focused view of the chat agent popup.
	•	User types:
“Hey Vibe, refactor the logging pipeline to use Cloudflare Queues instead of direct writes.”
	•	Agent responds step by step:
	1.	“Analyzing task dependencies…”
	2.	“Generating patch plan…”
	3.	“Dispatching to Data Factory…”
	•	Background elements of dashboard blur slightly; chat popup glows purple as the agent is “thinking”.
	•	WebSocket status pulse animates, symbolizing orchestration traffic.

→ Transition: fade to a schematic map of factories lighting up.

⸻

⚙️ Scene 3 — Factory Production Line (Live Orchestration)
	•	Show Factory Control View as a glowing conveyor map:
Agent Factory → Data Factory → Service Factory → Ops Factory
	•	Each factory node is a circular tile with activity rings:
	•	Agent Factory: Parsing intent (purple glow)
	•	Data Factory: Generating patch (blue pulse)
	•	Service Factory: Running static checks (cyan)
	•	Ops Factory: Deploying (green shimmer)
	•	A moving orb flows along the track — representing the “task.”
	•	Bottom dock shows WebSocket Console streaming:
PHASE_GENERATING → PHASE_IMPLEMENTING → PHASE_VALIDATING
	•	One node flashes red briefly (“static check failed”), then corrects itself (“deterministic code fix completed”).

→ Transition: the orb exits the conveyor and morphs into a code diff view.

⸻

🧩 Scene 4 — Patch Manager and Audit View
	•	Split screen:
	•	Left: Code diff viewer (unified diff) showing inserted and replaced lines with green highlights.
	•	Right: D1 Log Summary card showing patch ID, task UUID, agent name, and timestamp.
	•	Above diff:
“Patch generated by Optimization Specialist — verified by Orchestrator.”
	•	Small pop-up alert bottom right:
“Patch successfully applied via Python Patch Manager (18 lines replaced, TSC check OK).”
	•	Sidebar status: “Reporting to GitHub via core-github-api…”

→ Transition: fade into GitHub PR interface (mocked inside VibeHQ layout).

⸻

🔀 Scene 5 — Pull Request + Issue Resolution
	•	HeroUI-styled PR dashboard view within VibeHQ:
	•	PR title: “Auto-Fix: Replace logging pipeline with Cloudflare Queues”
	•	PR body snippet, status badge = Open, reviewers shown.
	•	Linked issue card to the right: “Runtime errors in logging worker — resolved.”
	•	Live comments appear: “✅ CI checks passed”, “🧠 AI review completed.”
	•	Progress bar animates to 100%, PR badge turns green = Merged.
	•	Toast notification: “Deployment pipeline triggered.”

→ Transition: zoom out from PR page to the global factory map.

⸻

🪄 Scene 6 — Global Mission Overview
	•	Full-screen panoramic Mission Control dashboard:
	•	Multiple project tiles (Helios, Orion, Pulse) with live statuses.
	•	Each tile shows mini factory activity lines.
	•	Top metrics strip:
	•	“Active Factories: 4”
	•	“Agents Online: 12”
	•	“Deployments Today: 6”
	•	“Open Issues: 3 (2 critical)”
	•	Right corner: chat agent mini avatar glowing green = “Idle / Ready”.
	•	Bottom dock: WebSocket logs flickering live.
	•	Text overlay:
“Every commit orchestrated. Every fix accountable. VibeHQ Mission Control.”

→ Final Transition: fade to VibeHQ logo with a subtle pulse and tagline.

⸻

🎨 Visual Language and Tone
	•	Color Palette: deep navy base (#0B0D10), neon blue accent (#4F46E5), cyan for active nodes, soft red for errors, lime for success.
	•	Typography: Inter or Satoshi; large semibold headings.
	•	Animation: fluid; 300–600ms ease-in-out transitions between scenes.
	•	Mood: cinematic mission control; high contrast, minimal clutter, all motion purposeful.
	•	Framework references: HeroUI React components styled as polished, production-ready prototypes.

⸻

🧠 Optional Overlays for Stitch
	•	Include captions below each frame:
	•	“User Command” → “AI Planning” → “Orchestration” → “Patch Application” → “PR Merge” → “Mission Overview”.
	•	Add minimal motion indicators: chat bubbles typing, status LEDs blinking, lines pulsing along factories.

✅ Deliverable

A six-scene storyboard visualizing the complete life cycle of an AI-driven development task within VibeHQ.
Each frame should transition naturally to the next, showing continuity in theme, color, and context.
Focus on illustrating data flow, orchestration, collaboration, and accountability.4
