		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Factory Base Dockerfile Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Factory Base Dockerfile implementation into subtasks for: 1) Setting up the base image with system dependencies, 2) Installing runtime environments (Node.js, Bun, Python), 3) Implementing container monitoring infrastructure with REST/WebSocket/RPC support",
			"reasoning": "This task requires creating a complex Dockerfile with multiple layers of dependencies, runtime environments, and monitoring systems. The implementation needs to integrate with Cloudflare sandbox, configure multiple language runtimes, and set up a comprehensive monitoring system with three different API types. The orchestrator integration adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Update Factory-to-Orchestrator Calls with PatchBatch Requests",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the factory-to-orchestrator integration into subtasks for: 1) Creating PatchBatch request models and validation, 2) Implementing RPC service binding submission method, 3) Implementing HTTP fallback submission method, 4) Adding WebSocket event handling for patch responses",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant architectural changes across multiple factory workers, replacing direct file operations with networked API calls. It requires implementing both RPC and HTTP submission methods, handling authentication, managing errors, and setting up WebSocket connections for event responses. The distributed nature and multiple integration points make this a complex task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Update Factories to Use Shared Contracts",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the shared contracts migration into subtasks for: 1) Auditing all factory workers to identify local type definitions that need replacement, 2) Updating import statements and removing duplicate definitions, 3) Updating validation logic and tests to use shared schemas",
			"reasoning": "This task requires changes across multiple factory workers to standardize on shared contract definitions. It involves identifying and removing duplicate code, updating import paths, and ensuring type safety throughout the codebase. The cross-cutting nature and potential for breaking changes increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "WebSocket Hub Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the WebSocket Hub implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the core WebSocketHub class with connection management, 2) Implementing broadcast functionality for different message types, 3) Adding connection lifecycle management with error handling and cleanup",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a WebSocket hub requires managing connection state, handling asynchronous events, and ensuring proper cleanup of resources. The broadcast functionality needs to handle different message types and potential failures. The Cloudflare Workers environment adds complexity due to its stateless nature and the need to use WebSocketPair API correctly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "WebSocket Routes Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the WebSocket routes implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the WebSocket upgrade endpoint with proper connection handling, 2) Integrating with the WebSocketHub for connection registration and management",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing WebSocket upgrade handling in the API routes, which requires understanding of the WebSocket protocol and Cloudflare's implementation. The integration with the WebSocketHub adds complexity, as does the need to handle connection lifecycle events properly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Secret Service Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Secret Service implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the core SecretService class with methods for retrieving secrets from environment variables, 2) Implementing container environment variable injection with validation",
			"reasoning": "The Secret Service needs to securely handle sensitive credentials without exposing them in logs or code. It requires careful error handling and validation to ensure required secrets are available. The container environment variable injection adds complexity but the overall task is relatively straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Update Route Registration in Orchestrator API",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a comprehensive implementation plan for updating the orchestrator API routes index file to register all new routes with proper context passing and error handling",
			"reasoning": "This task involves updating route registration in a central file, which is relatively straightforward. The main complexity comes from ensuring all routes receive the correct context objects and are properly wired to their implementations. The large number of dependencies indicates this task integrates many components but the actual implementation is not highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Update Service Bindings in Wrangler Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a detailed plan for updating the wrangler.base.jsonc file with all required service bindings, ensuring proper configuration for different environments",
			"reasoning": "This task involves updating configuration files with new service bindings, which is relatively straightforward. The main considerations are ensuring correct binding names and service references across different environments. The task has few technical challenges but requires attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 35,
			"taskTitle": "Worker Creation Script for Factory and Specialist Workers",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the worker creation script implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the core script structure with template copying and configuration, 2) Implementing orchestrator integration with service binding and database updates, 3) Adding validation, error handling, and deployment instructions",
			"reasoning": "This task requires creating a comprehensive bash script that handles multiple aspects of worker creation: copying templates, configuring settings, updating orchestrator configuration, and creating database migrations. The script needs robust error handling, validation, and must work across different environments. The integration with multiple systems increases complexity."
