# Project Structure - CRITICAL RULES

## Orchestrator Location - NEVER MOVE OR CREATE UNDER apps/

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The orchestrator is at the **root level**, NOT under `apps/`

- ✅ **Correct**: `orchestrator/` (at repository root)
- ❌ **WRONG**: `apps/orchestrator/` - This path does NOT exist and must NEVER be created
- ❌ **WRONG**: Creating new orchestrator files under `apps/orchestrator/`

**The orchestrator is a special worker that coordinates all other workers. It lives at the repository root, not under `apps/`.**

## Apps Directory Structure

- `apps/` contains independent Cloudflare Workers:
  - `apps/agent-factory/` - Agent generation worker
  - `apps/data-factory/` - Data operations worker
  - `apps/services-factory/` - External service proxy worker
  - `apps/ui-factory/` - UI/frontend worker
  - `apps/ops-specialists/` - Specialized operational workers

Each worker under `apps/` is deployed independently and has its own `wrangler.jsonc` configuration.

## File Naming Conventions

- Use **lowercase** for file names: `guardrail.ts` not `Guardrail.ts`
- Use **PascalCase** for class names: `GuardRailsOperation`
- Use **kebab-case** for directories: `project-clarification/`
